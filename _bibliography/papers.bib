	abstract = {Abstract
            Intraoperative margin analysis is crucial for the successful removal of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC). Artificial intelligence technologies (AI) have previously demonstrated potential for facilitating rapid and complete tumour removal using intraoperative margin assessment for basal cell carcinoma. However, the varied morphologies of cSCC present challenges for AI margin assessment. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of an AI algorithm for real‐time histologic margin analysis of cSCC. To do this, a retrospective cohort study was conducted using frozen cSCC section slides. These slides were scanned and annotated, delineating benign tissue structures, inflammation and tumour to develop an AI algorithm for real‐time margin analysis. A convolutional neural network workflow was used to extract histomorphological features predictive of cSCC. This algorithm demonstrated proof of concept for identifying cSCC with high accuracy, highlighting the potential for integration of AI into the surgical workflow. Incorporation of AI algorithms may improve efficiency and completeness of real‐time margin assessment for cSCC removal, particularly in cases of moderately and poorly differentiated tumours/neoplasms. Further algorithmic improvement incorporating surrounding tissue context is necessary to remain sensitive to the unique epidermal landscape of well‐differentiated tumours, and to map tumours to their original anatomical position/orientation.},
