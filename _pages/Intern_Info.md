  <h2>Intern FAQ</h2>

  <p><strong>Q: Should I pitch individually or in a group?</strong><br>
  A: We strongly encourage you to pitch in subteams (2+ people). Group pitches usually result in stronger ideas and better collaboration over the summer.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What’s the guidance on forming groups for pitching?</strong><br>
  A: After pitch presentations, the mentor team will review ideas. If multiple subteams propose similar projects, we may suggest: Collaborating to form a larger group, exploring different angles of the same topic, and/or pivoting to other projects if one is already well-covered.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: When is my pitch presentation due?</strong><br>
  A: Plan to have your pitch presentation ready by the <strong>2nd or 3rd meeting</strong>. The first meeting is meant for discussing potential projects. Use Slack #project-scoping and office hours for help.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: When is the design document due?</strong><br>
  A: A <strong>draft design document</strong> should be ready by your pitch presentation. Finalize it based on mentor feedback by the <strong>end of Week 3</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Can I work on more than one project this summer?</strong><br>
  A: We recommend focusing on <strong>one</strong> project for the summer. This allows for deeper engagement and more meaningful outcomes.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Can I continue my work after the end of the summer?</strong><br>
   A: Yes! We often invite students whose projects are nearing publication to continue their work with us into the fall semester or beyond to complete their manuscript and submit for publication.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Will I receive a letter of recommendation?</strong><br>
  A: Yes! — if you meet all expectations (see below).</p>
