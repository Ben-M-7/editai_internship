The EDIT AI internship program, hosted by Dartmouth Health and the Dartmouth Cancer Center’s CRTEC Initiative, was founded in 2019 within the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. This pioneering program aims to inspire high school students from diverse socio-economic and geographic backgrounds to explore innovative career pathways at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine.

Over the past five years, the program has grown from an inaugural class of six students representing two states to supporting 91 participants annually from 21 states (2024 cohort). To date, over 210 students have engaged in the internship, gaining technical expertise, exploring medical specialties, and applying AI to solve complex biomedical problems. The program offers three tracks tailored to students’ interests:

*Skills Track:* Focused on foundational programming and machine learning techniques.
*Advanced Track:* Emphasizing research, publications, and innovative projects.
*Peer Mentor Track:* Combining research with mentorship responsibilities.

Through a blend of project-based work, seminars, and guided research, interns develop computational methods to assess and integrate diverse biomedical data, including whole slide images, pathology text reports, metagenomic sequences, graphs, electronic health records, and multi-omics data types. The program also strengthens soft skills like communication, teamwork, and scientific writing, enabling participants to present their findings to clinical and research audiences.

*EDIT AI has made a significant impact on its participants:*

*Academic Advancement:* All alumni have pursued higher education in prestigious colleges and universities, some are nearing graduation.
*Global Recognition:* Participants have presented their research and projects on international platforms.
*Scholarly Contributions:* A significant number of students have authored publications in peer-reviewed journals, contributing valuable insights to the fields of AI and healthcare.
*Scholarship Awards:* Numerous students have earned scholarships based on their achievements and innovations during the internship.
