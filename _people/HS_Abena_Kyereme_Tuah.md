**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School. Currently, my favorite class is Artificial Intelligence because of the types of problems that I am able to solve in that class. I also enjoy dancing, reading, and playing my violin.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I would like to participate in research about trends in different diseases. I would like to use machine learning to assess the development of symptoms and the progression of recovery or deterioration. I am also interested in seeing the effects treatment has on the trend.
