**School:** Deep Run High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Abhinav Gitta, and I am a rising junior at Deep Run High School. This will be my first year participating in the EDIT ML internship program, and I am excited to learn more about machine learning and its applications to biomedical research. I am interested in deep learning, quantum physics, and mathematics. In my free time, I play the piano and going to the gym. I also enjoy playing ping pong and spamming pull ups.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am most interested in the ArcticAI project. I am also interested in the Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes project. I'm also open to any projects that focus on Computer Vision (especially image analysis and segmentation) and semi-supervised Deep Learning.
