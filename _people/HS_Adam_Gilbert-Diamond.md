**School:** Hanover High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am a rising senior at Hanover High School. I am passionate about math and computer science, and I am excited to learn more about applications of machine learning in medical research this summer. I have programming experience in C, Python, Java, and JS, but Python is my preferred language. I am a rower and nordic skier, and in my free time, I enjoy baking and gardening.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am especially interested in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences and Radiation Oncology, but I would be happy to work on a project in another area too.
