**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Afya Shaikh and I am a freshman at Burlington High School. I’m driven by a passion for integrating AI and machine learning technologies to positively change the medical field. I aim to tackle the complexities of dermatology, oncology, and pathology by enhancing and accelerating processes and improving patient outcomes by using the ever-growing world of technology! Beyond my passion for STEM, I'm deeply involved in a range of clubs, from programming to environmental advocacy to medicine. As the secretary of my school's Student Government, I'm dedicated to building a strong sense of community among my peers. I love inspiring others, being a team leader, and advocating for causes I care about. I enjoy expressing myself through my art and using it as a powerful tool for advocacy, notably through the UNHCR Hope Away From Home Competition, where I was able to advocate for the displacement of refugees. When I’m not covered in acrylics you’ll often find me wrapped up with a good book, blanket, and hot cocoa.
