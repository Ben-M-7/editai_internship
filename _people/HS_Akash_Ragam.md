**About Me:**
I am currently a junior at Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon. I have been involved in science fairs and robotics throughout middle and high school, and I have a keen interest in combining software and hardware into real-world solutions. One of my favorite projects was building a self-navigating cane for the visually impaired. Outside of my passion for machine learning and biomedical engineering, I play soccer year-round and love hanging out with friends. I also love traveling to new places and trying new food!

**Project/Research Interests:**
Deep Learning Techniques, Computer Vision/Image Segmentation, Spatial Transcriptomics, 3D Modeling of Tumors, Proteomics
