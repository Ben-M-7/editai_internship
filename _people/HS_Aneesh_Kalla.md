**About Me:**
I’m a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Toward the end of middle school, I learned about a lot of the advancements being made in brain interfaces. If this technology is successfully developed, it could help improve the quality of human life, and solve many other problems. Since then I’ve developed an interest in machine learning. I’m taking AP computer science and AP biology, and I’m in the machine learning club, AI research club, and bioinformatics club.


**Project/Research Interests:**
Pathology, Radiation Oncology, 3D Tissue Engineering
