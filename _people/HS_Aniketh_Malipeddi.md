**About Me:**
Hey! I’m Aniketh, a student passionate about the intersection of technology, ethics, and real-world impact. I’m particularly interested in how computer science and data analysis can be applied responsibly in fields like medicine, public health, and finance. Outside of academics, I enjoy working on creative projects, playing video games with friends, and both playing and watching sports(especially soccer and basketball). I’m excited by programs like EDIT that bring together interdisciplinary research and ethical reflection to drive change.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Ethical AI, Digital Pathology, Public Health, CV for Diagnosis, 3D Modeling
