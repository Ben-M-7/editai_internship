**About Me:**
Anish is freshman at TJHSST who specializes in data analytics, ML, complex Python and R programming, and web/app development. In the past, he has worked with the Software team at Project Caelus to develop the Ground Station for a liquid-fueled rocket which sends, receives, and displays data in an effective way. Additionally, he worked with Potentia Robotics to develop an optimal gait generation trajectory for their humanoid robot. A few of Anish's side interests include playing chess, tennis, and reading. He is a curious individual who is looking to expand his knowledge and explore his passions in computer science through the EDIT ML program at Dartmouth.
