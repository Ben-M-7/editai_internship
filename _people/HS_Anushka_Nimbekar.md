**School:** Briar Woods High School/Academies of Loudoun (AET)

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Skills Development

**About Me:**
My name is Anushka Nimbekar and I am so excited to have been given this opportunity. I am currently a junior in highschool and live in Virginia (close to the DC area!). Throughout my high school career so far, I have explored the basics of programming (java) and robotics through First Tech Challenge (FTC). Although my main interest is aerospace engineering, astrophysics, and all things space, I want to now apply those skills that I have developed to another area that interests me - biomedical engineering - and gain more experience in the field I will at least minor in for college. I am a great team player and love to learn from not only those who are more experienced from me, but from all my peers. I am looking forward to working on projects during the summer!

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am more inclined to the engineering side of the internship. I would like to explore how I can incorporate robotics with biomedical engineering, and possibly how to apply those concepts for space and extraterrestrial applications.
