**About Me:**
My name is April Lin, and I am from Woodside High School in Newport News, Virginia. I enjoy learning anything new such as new ideas or fun facts. Currently, I am trying to learn new programming skills. For fun, I enjoy playing tennis and playing with my dog.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm not sure if this is asking us to choose a project from the website, but if it is then I am interested in the Arctic AI project and the CRISPR Off-Target Effects.
