**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Archi Marrapu and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, interested in the interdisciplinary study of medicine, advanced technology, such as Artificial Intelligence, and engineering. I've done various projects in this intersected field and participated in extensive research. I am the Founder & President of STEMifyGirls, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization aiming to close the gender gap in STEM fields by empowering girls from a young age. I am invited to many STEM events across the Washington D.C., Virginia, and Maryland areas to promote STEM by example and to speak as a keynote.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I would love to work on projects based on bioengineering, 3D tissue engineering, and pathology. Nanotechnology is also something that I've been wanting to work on for a long time, so any sort of opportunity to work with this under supervision would be great!
