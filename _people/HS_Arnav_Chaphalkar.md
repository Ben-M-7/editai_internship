**School:** Adlai E. Stevenson High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**

**About Me:**
I’m a freshman who loves using technology to build real, tangible solutions that make a difference in people’s lives. I'm passionate about innovation and constantly looking for new ways to apply creative thinking to real-world problems. Outside the world of problem-solving, I love traveling, hiking, and learning about new cultures, and I’m also a competitive fencer and congressional debater.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Computer Vision for Image Classification, Object Detection, and Segmentation. Applications of CNNs, NLP, and other AI models, and their intersection with pathology across diverse domains.
