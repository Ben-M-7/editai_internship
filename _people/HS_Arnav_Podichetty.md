**About Me:**
I am 16 years old and a junior at Trabuco Hills High School. I am currently in the IB program and take all of the hardest classes at my school. My favorite subjects are math, history, and computer science. Other than academics, I spent a lot of my time in other academic and service clubs and love learning and volunteering. In my free time, I like to read books, watch movies, play games, learn coding, or hang out with friends.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Some of my researching interests are in pathology, dermatology, epidemiology, and quantitative biomedical sciences.
