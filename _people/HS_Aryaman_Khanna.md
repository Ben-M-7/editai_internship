**About Me:**
Hi! I'm Aryaman Khanna and I'm a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I am passionate about Machine Learning and Computer Vision and their endless real-world applications. Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends, rowing on my school's Crew team, working on personal projects related to ML/CV, and watching the NFL and NBA. I am looking forward to gaining valuable research experience this summer!

I am open to a variety of projects, but my main interests focus on Computer Vision (including image analysis and segmentation), Semi-supervised Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.
