**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Aryan and I'm a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I enjoy playing basketball, watching the NBA and different anime series, coding, and tutoring elementary school students. Within coding, I love the field of AI and machine learning, especially learning new learning models and algorithms.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Any form of AI/Machine Learning honestly, with image datasets? But numerical analysis is fine as well. Perhaps if I could see the project list then I would have a better idea on which projects I would be interested in, don't really remember the project examples discussed during the interview.
