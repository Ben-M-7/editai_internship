I am a highly motivated rising junior at Sunset High School in Portland OR, hoping to study and pursue computer science. In school, I run a machine learning club, where I develop curriculum for technical and conceptual machine learning. I am additionally involved in after-school science fair, competitive programming, and math. In my free time, you can find me working to teach students game development, spending time with family, playing racquetball, or creating art.
