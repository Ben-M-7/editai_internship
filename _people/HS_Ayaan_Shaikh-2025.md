**About Me:**
Hi, my name is Ayaan Shaikh, and I’m a senior at Burlington High School with a strong passion for artificial intelligence and its applications in medicine, especially in diagnostic pathology and neuroscience. This is my second year in the lab, and I enjoy exploring how machine learning can transform healthcare. Outside of academics, I founded Helyx, a nonprofit that introduces students to unique areas of STEM through workshops and mentorship. I’m also a nationally ranked competitive archer and in my free time, I enjoy coding, playing badminton, and advocating for environmental sustainability.

**Project/Research Interests:**
ML, NLP, and computer vision applied to genomic and molecular data, DNA methylation, cancer biomarkers, neuroscience, cognitive science, and public health.
