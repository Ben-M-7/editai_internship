**About Me:**
Hi, my name is Ayaan Shaikh, and I am a junior at Burlington High School. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in diagnostic pathology, and I love exploring the various ways machine learning can transform healthcare. Beyond the classroom, I founded Helyx, an initiative that introduces students to unique areas of STEM through workshops, competitions, and guest speakers. When I'm not busy with academics, I'm a nationally ranked competitive archer, and in my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, coding, and advocating for environmental causes.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Computational Pathology, biomedical sciences, public health, ML/engineering
