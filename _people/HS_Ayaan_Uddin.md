**About Me:**
Hello, my name is Ayaan and I am a sophomore at Northside College Prep. Ever since the advent of ChatGPT, I have become very interested in machine learning and would like to continue to gain more knowledge in the field. In my free time, I volunteer at the Red Cross and tutor children that are in elementary school. I also run for my school's track and field team.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am open to researching anything to further my skills and learn new things.
