**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Bhavana, and I am a current sophomore in high school. Fun fact - I technically skipped fifth grade! It’s a very long story. 
I got into computer science towards the end of my freshman year. I came across this program while stalking people on LinkedIn, and being that I was actively looking for programs and internships at the time, this opportunity seemed like the perfect opportunity. 
Apart from computer science, I am involved in my school’s choir program, yearbook (I’m an editor next year!!), math club and many other things. In my spare time, I like to binge watch shows on Netflix (just finished 19 seasons of Greys Anatomy in three weeks!), reading, cooking and sleeping.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Dermatology, Biomedical Engineering
Interested in researching skin cancer, lichen planus, and other related skin conditions
