    **School:** Oakland Technical High School

    **EDIT ML Program Track:**
    Advanced Research

    **About Me:**
    My name is Charlie, I am from Oakland, California where I just finished my junior year of high school. I love playing guitar, basketball (let's go Dubs), and science. I am excited to spend the summer not just reading science but actually getting my hands dirty and collaborating on a research project to uncover something new and useful on an important biomedical question.

    **Project/Research Interests:**
    I would like a research project where I can utilize my programming skills and maybe even my advanced math skills to work on a medical problem of current interest, ideally in gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases but I am also interested in cancer researh, in epidemiology, quantitative biomedical sciences, 3d tissue engineering,  and pathology.
