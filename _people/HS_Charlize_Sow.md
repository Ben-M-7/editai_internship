**About Me:**
Hi! I'm Charlize, a freshman at Phillips Academy Andover. I'm super passionate about surgery and biomedical research, and am also an avid squash player. In addition to my academic and athletic interests, I love doing art (particularly digital art and ceramics), playing the violin, and participating in musical theatre!

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR, and their potential to treat genetic disorders. I am also passionate about using computational tools to model gene editing outcomes, optimize experimental conditions, and improve clinical efficiency. Additionally, I am interested in developing biomedical solutions that could potentially bridge healthcare gaps in underserved communities, especially in dentistry and preventative care.
