**About Me:**
I'm a rising senior at TJHSST, and I have an interest healthcare and medicine. Last summer, I co-led a capstone project focusing on health disparities, which is why I'm interested in using computer science to improve public health. I'm also a member of my school's HOSA team, and I enjoy competing in entrepreneurship competitions such as Conrad to use innovative technologies to advance healthcare. Outside of school, you can find me trying new recipes or reading novels.

Cancer cells, immunology, neuroscience (learning and memory), CRISPR and gene editing
