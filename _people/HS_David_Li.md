**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is David Li, a rising senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandra VA. I have always been passionate about Mathematics and Computer Science, and am eager to study and research in the fields that involve both subjects, such as Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. During my exploration of these topics, I have been truly amazed on how technology development in AI and Data science can impact peopleâ€™s everyday life.
I have reviewed the high-level introduction about the on-going projects in the EDIT ML High School Summer Internship Program and I am very interested in the projects: multimodal modeling, pathology reports and ML+Statistics. I want to apply machine learning natural language processing algorithms to extract patterns from pathology reports to inform care and reimbursement and identify ambiguity in the text which may obfuscate findings/reimbursement. Recently I have worked on a research project by combining my love for debate and computer science to use NLP to detect fake news with the AI Inspirit research program. I have explored various machine learning techniques and approaches, and, by combining these skills with NLP, have drastically improved the accuracy and effectiveness of my fake news detection model to 95%. Last summer I did an AI project to do breast cancer biopsy classification and got valuable experience.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am very interested in the projects: NLP on pathology reports and ML+Statistics.
