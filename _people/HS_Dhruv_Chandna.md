**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am a sophomore at TJHSST and I am very interested in data science and machine learning. In particular, I like to explore the various applications of ML in the medical field. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis for my high school team, practicing guitar in the school jazz band, and reading books.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in applying ML to create applications and software. One ongoing EDIT project that caught my eye was the one on applying strain normalization techniques on the image data. Another one was the one on using an NLP model on pathology reports. In any project, however, I would like to be able to not only apply a ML model for some task, but to also be able to integrate it in a way in which it could be deployed as an application.
