**School:** Sardar Patel Institute of Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I have an incredible interest for Deep Learning and research, especially in the fields of intelligence and reasoning in language models (neuro symbollism). I feel this is because of my initial interest in philosophy, I love to ask questions about consciousness and truth, hence i want to spearhead research in that direction, where I can constantly ask cross-domain questions and find answers. Otherwise, I'm also currently involved in research in college relating to behavior based Biometrics using time series classification.  I really want to pursue a PhD in the future, as soon as it is possible. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
Multimodal Modelling, Pathology reports, ML+Statistics/Explainability, Federated Learning
