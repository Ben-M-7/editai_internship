**School:** New Horizons Governor's School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
Thanks for stopping by! My name is Doni, a passionate student leader in the Hampton Roads Region currently attending the Governor's School for Science and Technology at New Horizons, concurrently with Tabb High School. 
Ever since my eye-opening encounter with medicine during my Sophomore-year summer as a clinical observer in the Operation Room (for Interventional Cardiology procedures and Vascular surgery operations), I got hooked to this subject. Suddenly, it was my pursuit of this field through my Junior-year research project in biomedical engineering where I found that the intersection of computation, engineering, and medicine was where my heart and brain loved and enjoyed (respectively) the most. In this project, I created a random forest regression powered biomedical device to track blood pressure through light sensor data.
Outside of biomedicine, I am a big leadership guy and participate in my school's student council as the Executive Board President and as a youth representative for my local government, whilst serving the community through my elementary school chess program called "Kings and Pawns.".

**Project/Research Interests:**
Biomedical Engineering / Biotechnology / Ensemble and Cascade Machine Learning
