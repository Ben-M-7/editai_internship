**School:** TJHSST

**About Me:**
I'm a big machine learning enthusiast. I love approaching and tackling real world problems with AI and machine learning and trying my best to make an impact on the world. I am also an avid public forum debater and I run track and field for my school.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Ophthalmology. Computer vision tasks. I am also very open to many different things and I hope to expand my horizons and learn new things, so it doesn't have to be strictly computer vision or ophthalmology.
