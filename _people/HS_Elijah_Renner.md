I'm a rising 12th-grade Vermont student. I'm incredibly fascinated by the vast literature of AI solutions in healthcare that is emerging. I can't wait to work with you all this summer! In my free time I enjoy running, swimming, basketball, pool, the AoPS forums, and LOTS of 3Blue1Brown, Presh Talwalkar, and Prime Newtons.

Segmentation, diffusion, natural language processing
