**About Me:**
I am a rising senior at The Bromfield School, and I'm interested in pursuing a career in pathology and research. Outside of school, I love music and play a wide range of instruments from drums to guitar to bagpipes. I'm an active member of my high school's Quiz Team, Drama Society, and Varsity Tennis Team. I love learning languages in my free time, programming languages included! Overall, I'm so excited to have the opportunity to work alongside all these very smart and talented people.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in working on research and applications in the areas of Pathology and Dermatology to improve clinical outcomes for patients and providers.
