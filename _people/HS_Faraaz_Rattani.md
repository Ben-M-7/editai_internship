**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am extremely passionate about AI and exploring the field of AI. I have worked on previous AI research and I hope to continue learning and starting new projects through the EDIT program. I also have explored various languages including C++, HTML, and JAVA which I really enjoy learning more about and when I should apply each language to each situation. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball and currently play for my high school team. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
This would be the order in interest that I would want: 

1) Pathology 
2) Engineering (3D tissue engineering),
3) Quantitative Biomedical Sciences,
4) Epidemiology,
5) Dermatology 
6) Radiation Oncology

I am most interested in Pathology and Engineering because I find them interesting in their applications of detecting and classifying different diseases to analyzing tissue formation to optimize the design of tissue-engineered parts. I find these two most interesting, but I am open to exploring all the other interests as well.
