**School:** High Technology High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am a junior at High Technology High School and I'm interested in the applications of computer science in biomedical applications. I compete in inline speed skating at the national level and am an active member in my school's Research Experimental Group, completing many independent research projects such as using federated learning for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. I am very excited to do more research this summer through this EDIT ML internship. I also enjoy playing basketball and going to the gym in my free time.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm interested in biological NLP to diagnose based on doctors appointment notes, using computer vision for disease diagnosis, and epidemiology.
