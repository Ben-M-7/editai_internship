**About Me:**
I am a freshman at TJHSST. I’m interested in pathology research and exploring how machine learning can play a role in pathology, like helping to analyze data or make diagnoses faster, and it’s exciting to see how technology can make a difference. Outside of school, I like to draw and watch soccer whenever I have some free time.
