**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Ishita Sengar, and I am a freshman at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I was interested in joining the EDIT program because I would like to expand my knowledge in the intersecting fields of machine learning and biology. I have been also interested in learning more about the applications of machine learning in the Quantum field as well.
In my free time I enjoy going on hikes with my family and dog and playing badminton. I also enjoy participating in policy debate competitions and I am part of the Varsity Policy Debate Team, as well as the math team.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I would be interested in researching more in the pathology field. I am open to any project research, however, my main interest would be more within the research statistic part to the projects as well as the detection/analyzation of detecting diseases and issues.
