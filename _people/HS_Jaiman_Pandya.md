**About Me:**
Hello! I'm Jaiman, and I currently attend Trabuco Hills High School in Mission Viejo, California. I've been interested in computer science primarily throughout high school, but I also love chemistry and perform research in both fields. I want to work with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics in college with applications relevant to research and the industry. I've competed in the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), placing in the Platinum Division after solving multitudes of algorithmic programming challenges. Now, I teach problem-solving methodologies and competitive programming at Recursive Dragon, an innovative company run by CS majors at Carnegie Mellon offering services for USACO and FAANG interviews. In addition, I'm currently doing research at Chapman University in polymer chemistry, which allows me to use equipment like scanning electron microscopes and create innovative experiments! Side Note: One of the polymers I worked with called Nipam smells absolutely horrendous

**Project/Research Interests:**
artificial intelligence, material science, chemistry, machine learning, data science, and disease classification.
