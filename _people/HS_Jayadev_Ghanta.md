**School:** Lynbrook High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Jayadev Ghanta, and I am a rising junior with a passion for Research, Programming, Mathematics, Music, and Sports. When I am not engaged in programming or research, I enjoy listening to music and singing. My ultimate career objective is to become a Computer Scientist.

In terms of experience, I worked as a research student at ASDRP, where I focused on ML Drug Discovery. During this time, I gained valuable experience in identifying patterns and relationships between molecular structures, reactivity, and chemical transformations through the use of ML algorithms. Additionally, I completed a Deep Learning course on Coursera and built a deep learning library from scratch using Numpy. Currently, I am working on identifying cancerous nodules in CT scan images of the lungs based on data from the 2016 Luna grand challenge. I taught Java to middle school students.

As part of my USACO Gold preparation, I spent significant time learning and working with advanced algorithms and data structures, including but not limited to shortest paths, disjoint set union, topological sort, Flood Fill, Graph traversals, MSTs, Dynamic Programming (DP), DP on trees, Combinatorics, Stacks, Queues, Sliding Windows, greedy algorithms, and prefix sums.
