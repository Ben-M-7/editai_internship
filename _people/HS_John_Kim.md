**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
Hey, I'm John and I'm currently a junior! I enjoy photography and use my free time to take photos every once in a while. I also code projects that mainly focus on machine learning, but AI in a more broad sense. I play video games as well (I'm not a robot :P)!
