Advanced Research

**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Jonathan Feldman, and I am an incoming college freshman interested in applying AI within many fields. I have experience using AI within academia, industry, and government. 
I am currently working at the United States State Department, where I build LLMs to summarize documents and serve in a question-answering capacity. 
I am incredibly excited to participate in the 2024 EDIT AI summer internship and look forward to continuing my AI-focused research!

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in using computer vision or multimodal AI models for predictive analytics, especially for intracellular and oncological phenomena.
