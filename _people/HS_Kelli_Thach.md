**About Me:**
HI my name is Kelli Thach. I am a student at Skyline high school. I have always lived in Oakland. The thing I like most about Oakland is the diversity. I enjoy learning about fascinating things. Last summer I did a summer camp at California schools for the blind about discover astronomy and 3d printing. I loved it, I loved learning about space and printing models of meteors, planets and more. I enjoy ceramics, making different cups or bowls. I like ceramics because it's fun and I could make anything I wanted, be as creative as I wanted. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
learn/discover about this type of thing. Searching for specific type of science that I may want to pursue.
