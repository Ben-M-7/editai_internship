**About Me:**
Hi! I’m LangXi (Lacie) Zhou, and I will be going into my junior year in high school next school year. I’m really excited to be part of the lab and to learn from everyone here! I’m especially interested in gaining hands-on experience, building technical/research skills, and contributing to projects that have real-world applications. Outside of academics, I enjoy music, playing badminton, and drawing. I'm looking forward to this summer and meeting everyone!

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am particularly interested in exploring biomedical research, medical technology, data analysis, and other areas that connect medicine with the growing field of technology. I’m eager to contribute to any project and deepen my understanding of the medical field. I would love the opportunity to apply my skills in computer science, mathematics, and the sciences, as well as my past experience annotating squamous cells using machine learning. I’m also excited to expand my knowledge in machine learning and explore any new, innovative topics. I look forward to working with a collaborative team to tackle real-world challenges through research.
