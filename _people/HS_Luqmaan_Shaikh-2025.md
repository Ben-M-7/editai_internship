**About Me:**
My name is Luqmaan Shaikh, and I am an incoming first-year student at Tufts University. I am deeply interested in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and healthcare, with a particular focus on the application of machine learning to neurodegenerative diseases, pathology, and broader healthcare challenges. Beyond my academic interests, I am passionate about public health and co-founded my school's Helyx Club, a biochemistry and STEM-focused organization dedicated to fostering STEM education and development within our community. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis, badminton, and mountain biking. I am excited to participate in the EDIT ML program at Dartmouth and look forward to expanding my knowledge and experiences in this field.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Computational Pathology, Neurodegenerative Diseases, MRI Imaging, and Quantitative Biomedical Sciences
