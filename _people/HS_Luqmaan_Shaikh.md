I am specifically interested in Machine learning and its application to Neurodegenerative diseases and pathology. I am really passionate about Public Health, and I am the co-founder of my school's Helyx Club, a Biochemistry/STEM-focused club aimed at fostering STEM development and education within our schools. Outside of that, I enjoy playing Tennis, Badminton, and Mountain Biking. I am really looking forward to this program and am excited about expanding my horizons in the EDIT ML program at Dartmouth.
