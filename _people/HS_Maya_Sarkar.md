**School:** Mission San Jose High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Maya Sarkar and I am a high school freshman. I enjoy participating in math competitions, coding competitions, and my Girls Who Code club at school. Additionally, I have a big passion for using machine learning to aid people with diseases in disadvantaged areas. Some hobbies that I like to do in my free time are working out, reading books, and singing.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in working on a project that focuses on personalized medical care for chronic and serious diseases like IBD and cancer where I can have a greater impact. I would like to process large multimodal data sets for analysis, where I can correlate information from the multiple modalities. One of my recent projects on IBD involved both genetic and colonoscopic image data - however I did not get a correlated data set. Multimodal data and clinical history can enable me to work towards personalized medicine which will lead to targeted treatment.
