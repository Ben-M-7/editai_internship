**About Me:**
Well I really like technology and games. I like it because you'll learn something new. I'm kind and friendly person but sometimes I can be shy when there's a lot of people. And I can be very forgetful so I really love to take notes and put everything in my notebook because it's all there.

**Project/Research Interests:**
What research project I'm interested is. learning more about AI Medical and how it was created or when it was created. See how the AI Medical function. Or how the AI Medical would work with a data.
