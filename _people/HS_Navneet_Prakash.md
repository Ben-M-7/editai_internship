**School:** Irvington High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Navneet Prakash, and I am a sophomore at Irvington High School in California. I enjoy working with and using tools such as AI, data science, and machine learning, and I am particularly interested in analysis and research. I have a deep interest in biology and chemistry as well and am highly interested in the intersection between these topics and data science/AI. I have worked on research regarding using topological data analysis to find patterns in drugs that treat neurodegenerative diseases as well as discover new drugs for this purpose. 

Furthermore, I enjoy learning new things greatly in general. An officer in my school's debate club, I qualified for and attended the Tournament of Champions for Parliamentary Debate (the highest national-level tournament). I have also qualified for the National Leadership Conference in FBLA (the highest-level competition) in a business-related topic area. In my free time, I like to run and am on the Varsity Cross Country and Track & Field teams for my school. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
I would be open to working on a great variety of projects and learning about new concepts, but I generally enjoy Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Explainable AI, CRISPR, genomics, pharmacovigilance, AI-enabled diagnostics, and more.
