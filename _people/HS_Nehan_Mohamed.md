**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I’m a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), where I’ve focused on the intersection of biology and computer science. Through advanced coursework and hands-on research, I’ve developed a passion for using computational tools to explore biological questions and improve human health. I’m excited to pursue both fields in college and to contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary solutions through programs like EDiT at Dartmouth.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm interested in building AI-powered tools for medical diagnostics, such as using CNNs to analyze histopathology slides or integrating genomic and imaging data to improve tumor classification. I’m also curious about how large language models can assist in generating synthetic biomedical data or identifying hidden drug interactions. These projects combine my passion for computational innovation with real-world health impact.
