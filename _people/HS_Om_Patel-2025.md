**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Om Patel, and I am passionate about using AI to bridge medicinal gaps. As an intern at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, I work to enhance urological disease detection through CT imaging and speed up the process of diagnosing individuals to mere seconds. Most of my high school time was spent researching at the Penn State University department of CS&E and Carnegie Mellon University SCS, where I worked on LLMs and their applications in debugging and large-scale reasoning with smaller models. Currently, I  am working on an approach for rheumatologists to help diagnose FMS rapidly and objectively which I hope to continue for the rest of my high school career. Outside of machine learning, I enjoy running, soccer, economics, and raspberry cheesecake-flavored ice cream.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Automated segmentation of images
Proper masking of images in abnormal cases
Epigenetic Clock Modeling and Aging prediction
Graph-Based Genomic Analysis
