**About Me:**
Hello!! My name is Omolara Dawson, and I am a junior at Grafton High School in Yorktown, Virginia. My curiosity about cancer began when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. I've always been passionate about scientific research and have been participating in science fairs since second grade, and I participated in Nasa hunch this year. I have also taken coding classes with Girls Who Code, and I am also a member of our schools robotics team! I am also very interested in art-related things, and I love drawing. As I've gotten older, I've participated in multiple competitions and am currently enrolled in Ap art. Thank you for your time! 

**Project/Research Interests:**
Dermatology, radiation oncology, epidemiology,  pathology, quantitative biomedical sciences, engineering
