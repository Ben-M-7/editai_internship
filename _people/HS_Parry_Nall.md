**School:** Metea Valley High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Skills Development

**About Me:**
My name is Parry Nall, and I am a high school senior with a strong interest in computer science, engineering, and problem-solving through technology. I’ve developed projects in robotics, automation, and data analysis to solve real-world problems with practical and creative coding solutions. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing chess, competing in math competitions, and running.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I’m very excited to work with gigapixel pathology slide images and turn raw scans into clean data through advanced preprocessing like tissue segmentation. Also, I want to build convolutional neural networks that can classify small image patches and then experiment with autoencoders to discover hidden features. I also hope to explore graph neural networks to capture how cells interact in space. On the biomedical side, I’m interested in color-coded tumor margin mapping to predict where cancer is most likely to invade.
