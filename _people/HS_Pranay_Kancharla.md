**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Pranay Kancharla and I am a student at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I am interested in machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance. Outside of school, I enjoy watching sports and playing tennis. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in researching about AI to help asses medical images such as x-rays and MRIs to improve the accuracy of diagnosis so patients get a better understanding of their health and doctors are able to have a more streamlined experience when working with patients. The improved analysis can help identify trends in various diseases so doctors are better prepared to deal with them when such cases arise.
