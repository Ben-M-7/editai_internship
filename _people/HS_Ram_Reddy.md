**School:** TJHSST

**About Me:**
Hello my name is Ram Reddy and I am a rising Junior in TJ. I am interested in computer science, biology and engineering.

In my free time, I play strategy and simulator games and also program random projects for fun.

I have a twin sister and her name is Ramya Reddy.

I also do crew, bike and play tennis for fun.

Currently I am working on a project called Potentia Robotics that aims to build a six foot bi-pideal dynamically walking humanoid robot.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Research areas I am interested in include: using computer vision in pathology, advanced ancillary testing like CRISPR, and genomic medicine.
