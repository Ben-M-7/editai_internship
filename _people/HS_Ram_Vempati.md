**School:** TJHSST

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I'm Ram Vempati, a sophomore at TJHSST. I'm interested in machine learning, robotics, and biology, and the unique intersection these fields pose. I'm the vice president of DeepCerebri, a medicine x machine learning organization (incorporation pending) where I'm developing novel methods for cardiovascular disease detection from smartphones via photoplethysmography readings and neurological disease detection via saccadic eye biomarker gaze detection. I'm also working with MIT professors on developing a novel distracted driving detection system from CCTV camera footage for automated safe driving across the state. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
Object detection and localization, disease detection from samples/images, improvement of previous models.
