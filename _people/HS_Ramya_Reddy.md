**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
I'm currently a rising Junior at TJHSST. In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, and reading books. I'm a member of my school's Machine Learning, Computer Team, Chemistry Team, and Math Team clubs. Outside of school, I'm a programmer in Potentia Robotics, a team that's working to make the first full-sized humanoid robot built by high schoolers. I try to make an effort to learn new things all the time, so I'm looking forward to this program!

**Project/Research Interests:**
Advanced ancillary testing, Machine learning and computational diagnostic pathology, and Genomic Medicine
