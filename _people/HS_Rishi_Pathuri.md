**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science & Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I'm a junior at TJHSST with a strong interest in computer science, especially machine learning and its real-world applications. I've worked on projects in both finance and healthcare, and I enjoy combining technical skills with problem-solving. Outside of academics, I like playing basketball, following the stock market, and hanging out with friends. I'm looking forward to learning from others and exploring new challenges this summer.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm open to working on a variety of projects, but I'm especially interested in machine learning applied to financial problems like stock price prediction, options strategy modeling, and fraud detection. I also enjoy meaningful healthcare projects, such as using data to improve diagnostic accuracy or classify medical conditions. I'm looking forward to learning from mentors and contributing to something impactful.
