**School:** Rock Ridge High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am Rohan Matta, a junior at Rock Ridge High School and the Academies of Loudoun. I have completed AP CS A and the online machine learning courses from UCSD, and I am currently taking a post-AP class on data structures and machine learning (scheduled to finish in June). Currently, I am working to create a convolutional neural network that classifies various lung diseases, such as pneumonia, using the NIH Chest X-rays dataset. I am also the president of my schoolâ€™s competitive programming club and technical lead on my FIRST Robotics Competition team.

One of my biggest passions is making a societal impact. I spend much of my free time tutoring younger children and my peers, volunteering at local events, and holding classes to teach critical STEM skills.

**Project/Research Interests:**
From my machine learning experience, the projects that stood out to me most were those that involved computer vision/image analysis. As such, I would like to work on a project involving image classification or segmentation. Some recent topics in this field that I find interesting are image transformers, such as Swin, and 3D image analysis, whether that be through 3D connected algorithms or a slice based 2D analysis.

I also find multimodal modeling intriguing because it more closely mimics how human scientists and doctors approach problems. I aim to learn more about how machine learning models are able to understand and compile more than one type of data to make a decision, as well as just how much this affects their accuracy.
