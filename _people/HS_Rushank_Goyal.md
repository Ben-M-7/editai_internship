**About Me:**
I'm Rushank Goyal, a high school student from Bhopal, India. My interests lie in AI research in the life sciences and particularly biomedicine. My previous machine learning-based projects have included gonococcal antibiotic resistance prediction, intracerebral hemorrhage diagnosis in head CT scans, identification of methylation biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma in cell-free DNA, and quantum ML for early cancer detection. I've been selected to present my work at ISEF, RECOMB, UMich's AI Symposium, Sigma Xi's SRC and SRS, the European Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting, etc. In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube documentaries, managing my nonprofit (A2M2: a2m2global.org) and writing about social issues and current events.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Omics, Diagnostic Imaging, Machine learning
