**About Me:**
Hi! I'm Sanjay, and I'm I'm a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I live in Ashburn, Virginia, and I enjoy activities including reading, biking and playing lacrosse in my free time. The two things that everyone should know about me is that my birthday is on Christmas, and that my favorite is Post Malone: if you ever meet me in person, those are some great conversation starters. I also enjoy learning about a variety of things, from innovations in biomedical science and automotive engineering to the Weeknd's new album and March Madness. Most importantly however, I'm excited to be an intern at the EDIT ML program this summer!

Dermatology, Oncology, Biometrics (if possible and relevant)
