**School:** Hanover High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Skills Development

**About Me:**
I am a rising junior at Hanover High School who is curious to explore the applications of AI/ML in the biomedical field. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and the guitar. I am a black belt in Tae-Kwon-Do, and am also on my school's soccer and rowing teams. I am excited to participate in this program and eager to learn as much as possible this summer!

**Project/Research Interests:**
Maybe ML/AI, but I am open to anything!
