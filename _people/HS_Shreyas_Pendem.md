**About Me:**
I'm a high school sophomore interested in becoming a physician. At the moment, I tutor SAT Math and volunteer at a local children's museum to spread my gift knowledge to others. I have leadership experience of organizing Latin club membership and communicating better tutoring strategies to beginner tutors. I have over 130 volunteer hours and continue to serve my community. I have fulfilled the volunteer hour requirement, but I continue to volunteer to make connections with those around me and enjoy spending time learning with others. 

I have class rank 1 at my high school, and I have taken 6 AP courses so far. I'm python coding certified. I'm currently working on a passion project of creating a functional cardboard game controller using computer vision. I have previous experience in Convolutional Neural Networks and have familiarity in regressions.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Diagnosing diseases by different methods.
