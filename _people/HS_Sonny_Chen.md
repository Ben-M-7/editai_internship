**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am a passionate and curious mind in the world of computer science. I've been exploring computer science since I was 12 and have a strong base for a plethora of topics. Besides coding, I like to spend my free time swimming, playing basketball, or playing video games. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm interested in disease detection and prediction models. For example, the website states the Digital Spatial Profiler, which would be super cool to work with. Additionally, computational methods are very interesting, especially ones that are somewhat complex enough to have speedups. I'm not too comfortable working with genetics, but I would be fine giving it a try this summer.
