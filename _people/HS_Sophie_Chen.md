**About Me:**
I'm a junior at Caddo Magnet High! I'm interested in artificial intelligence and its applications in diagnostic pathology, and I enjoy exploring the various ways machine learning can transform healthcare. In my freetime, I'm a member of my school's mock trial team and an avid mental health advocate.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Computational Pathology, but I'm open to exploring fields new to me, such as Natural Language Processing and Genomics
