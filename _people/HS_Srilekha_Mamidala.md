**About Me:**
Srilekha Mamidala is a junior at Garnet Valley High School. Since she was young, she always loved math and computer science, and she is also very passionate about exploring important issues in her own community. 

Srilekha's projects are often interdisciplinary, and she is especially interested to see how she can use computer science to tackle biological and environmental issues. Srilekha's projects have ranged from cognitive disorder risk prediction for the elderly to food waste detection to computational drug repositioning strategies. She is excited to see how her projects, and computational biology in general, can help her community in the future. 

Outside of research, Srilekha has been an avid Indian classical dancer for more than 10 years. She has also participated in math competitions such as AMC, AIME, and ARML from a young age, and greatly enjoys logical thinking and problem solving. She also plays tennis and loves painting.
