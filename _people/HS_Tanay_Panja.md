**School:** Ann Arbor Huron High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
Tanay Panja is a 9th-grade student from Ann Arbor, Michigan, with a strong interest in mathematics, biology, programming, and research. He is a USA Biology Olympiad semifinalist, USA Computing Olympiad Silver qualifier, and a two-time grand prize winner at the Science and Engineering Fair of Metro Detroit in the field of software and robotics. Alongside participating in science competitions like Science Bowl and qualifying for nationals, he is a double bassist in his high school's symphony orchestra and a member of the school tennis team. He also volunteers his expertise to help the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital with technology/feedback and is actively involved in his school's key club and tutoring. To learn more about bioinformatics, he participated in the miRcore volunteer program at the University of Michigan, where he collaborates with other high school students to develop a better understanding of medicine and science, and helps with microgrant fundraisers for research. In his free time, he enjoys playing Microsoft Flight Simulator and hopes to get a pilot's license. Through this program, he aspires to learn about existing research and methods and collaborate with others to pursue research he is fascinated by.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Urothelial Carcinoma (autoparis), Novel Convolutional Neural Networks, iOS Application Development, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forests, ARIMA Algorithms, Screening of Cognitive Diseases, IoT Devices, Cloud-based Data Collection

Made an iOS application that screen for dementia through a simple written test called the Clock Drawing Test. It utilizes computer vision through multinomial logistic regression to screen cognitive dysfunction into six defined categories. 

Explored integrating Microbial Fuel Cells, IoT data collection, Firebase Storage, and time-series analysis using an ARIMA algorithm.
