**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, VA. I have a passion for STEM and also have a multiplicity of other academic interests, including history, economics, and languages. I am a long-distance track runner and I have gone on month-long backpacking trips of hundreds of miles through Spain, Portugal, and France. I am native in both English and French and I have lived in Poland for three years. I am enthusiastic about joining EDIT and look forward to contributing to the team's work.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I am interested in epidemiology, with a focus on the computational aspects. I am, however, open to other potential projects in pathology, quantitative biomedical sciences, and oncology.
