**About Me:**
Hi, I'm Varun! I'm currently at junior at Metea Valley High School located in Aurora, IL. I'm excited to join EDIT's AI/ML Internship Program because I want to learn more about machine learning and its intersection with biology. I love to take on challenges and try new things. In my free time, I enjoy helping out in my community, meeting new people, the outdoors, and watching shows/movies.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Anything with a high focus on using statistics with the early detection of blood clots and tumors
