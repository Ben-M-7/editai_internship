**About Me:**
Hi! My name is Vatsal. I'm a student at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, class of 2025, and an incoming summer intern for the EDIT ML Internship Program. I am passionate about researching and implementing Machine Learning in bioinformatics and health sciences, and a computer science enthusiast. I joined the Levy Lab to contribute to its mission of creating data driven solutions that solve public health problems, as well as further my experience in practical applications of ML. I look forward to working with new and powerful technologies, and working with like-minded peers that share my passion. In my free time, I LOVE playing chess, as well as learning my favorite Weeknd songs on the piano.
