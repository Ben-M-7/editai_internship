**About Me:**
Hi, I'm Victoria, and I am currently a sophomore at TJHSST. I am interested in both math and computer science, and enjoy exploring intersections of the two fields, such as in math modelling or machine learning. In AI, I love to learn about new models and their applications in a variety of fields, as well as their impact on existing structures. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and writing stories.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Computer vision and modeling and/or using unsupervised learning
