**School:** Bentonville High School

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
My name is Vivaan Mahajan and I'm currently a freshman at Bentonville High School with a strong interest in the field of biomedical AI. Through the EDIT AI Internship, Iâ€™m excited to contribute to cutting-edge biomedical research and further develop my skills in data science and computational biology. I'm particularly interested in exploring how AI can advance precision medicine and early disease detection.

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm interested in how AI can be used to uncover meaningful patterns in omics data and support more personalized, transparent healthcare. The use of spatially localized omics to understand cancer progression and the development of clinically relevant AI models strongly aligns with my interest in applying machine learning to genomics for disease prediction.
