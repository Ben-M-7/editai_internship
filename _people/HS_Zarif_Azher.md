**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
I'm currently a high school freshman in Northern Virginia, and I'm passionate about AI and machine learning - especially biological applications. Outside of related personal projects and school, I enjoy listening to music, playing and watching basketball, traveling, and keeping up with the world. I'm looking forward to working with like minded peers this summer!

**Project/Research Interests:**
I'm truly open to anything, but I'd be especially interested in a project related to: Proteomics/Genomics/Transcriptomics (ex; pathogenic potential prediction from genome), Computer Vision, Immunology, or biological NLP (ex; possible diagnostics based off doctors appointment notes).
