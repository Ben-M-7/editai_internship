**Name:** Lutz Lu (Yunrui Lu)

**Undergraduate:** Xiamen University, China

**Double Major:** BA in Mathematical Economics & BA in German Language and Literature

**About me:** I'm currently a master student at QBS. I'm interested in using Deep Learning methods to solve medical problems and public health issues. I'm currently doing NLP related research with Professor Josh. And I'm also interested in medical image problems and brain computer interface. When I'm not doing research or being a nerd, I like basketball, sneakers, CSGO, novel books and movies.
