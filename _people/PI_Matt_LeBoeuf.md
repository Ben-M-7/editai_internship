**Research Philosophy**
A positive patient experience is critical for the successful treatment of skin cancer. I am committed to providing each patient with the most comfortable experience, minimizing stress that can sometimes surround a surgical procedure. As a Mohs surgeon, my goal is to use microscopic examination to ensure complete removal of the skin cancer while minimizing the amount of tissue removed. Being confident that the skin cancer is gone with the least amount of normal tissue removed makes it easier to restore appearance and function. This powerful technique combined with a thoughtful and compassionate team is why I am committed to taking care of patients with skin cancer.
