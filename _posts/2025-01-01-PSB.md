#### Overview


The PSB, or *Pacific Symposium of Biocomputing*, is having it's 30th anniversary on the 3rd, so an EDIT AI team including [Leah Zhang](/people/HS_Leah_Zhang) (TJHSST), Edward Zhang (TJHSST), Sameeksha Garg (CMU), Sean McOsker (EDIT Mentor), and Dr. Joshua Levy worked on a project to study "what people at the (PSB) conference are talking about, and how it has changed over time."

The project consisted of 3 main parts: Leah Zhang worked with topic modeling to show how computational biology has changed over time at the conference. Sameeksha Garg mainly focused on the networking aspect of the conference, analyzing how its citation networks have changed over time. And Sean McOsker used RAG--retrieval augment generation-- to make an AI chatbot for use on PSB's website that can help people sort through the conference's immense collection of public papers.

>Leah Zhang is new to the EDIT program this year--She heard about it and joined a friend.
>When asked about her experience, she reported that she "Really appreciated the chance to work with people who weren't just highschoolers, as well as the skills she developed in a team setting."
>She also mentioned Dartmouth's Discovery cluster, "A really cool resource."




We wish Leah a great time at the conference, and we look forward to the new summer 2025 EDIT internship applications!
