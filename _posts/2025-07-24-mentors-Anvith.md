#### Background

Anvith Kakkera, 18, grew up in Northern Virginia and first joined EDIT AI as an intern in the summer of 2023. Enrolled in the Advanced Track, he dove headfirst into his research project on the *Cytological Evaluation of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Deep Learning Analysis of Thyroid Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsies* with fellow students and now mentors Anish Malepati and Aneesh kalla. While the project didn’t reach completion during the program window, Anvith’s curiosity and commitment carried it forward well beyond the summer.


That drive didn’t go unnoticed. In 2024, Dr. Levy invited him back as a peer mentor. Anvith accepted and went on to support two Skills Track teams, describing it as a deeply rewarding experience:

> *“I wanted to give back. And it was so awesome to see the students grow over the summer.”*

This summer, he’s returned once again — now co-leading Group 5 in the Advanced Track.

#### Looking Ahead

This fall, Anvith will begin his college journey at **Dartmouth College** as part of the Class of 2029. He plans to major in **Biology**, likely on a **Pre-Med track**, though he’s keeping an open mind as he continues to explore intersections between medicine, research, and technology.

#### Outside the Lab

Outside of research, Anvith enjoys running and has a background in track and field — a passion that mirrors his hard work when it comes to mentorship and science.

> Anvith’s steady growth from intern to mentor reflects the best of what EDIT AI hopes to cultivate: curiosity, perserverance, and the cultivation of skills reguarding the intersection of research, pathology, and ML. We’re proud to have him on the team.
