#### Background

Meet Vivek Pujara — a 37-year-old passionate researcher whose journey bridges biology, medicine, and artificial intelligence.

Vivek began his academic path as a pre-med student, earning a degree in Biological Sciences at UC Irvine. Through his clinical research, he became deeply interested in neuroscience and genomics. At UC Irvine, he contributed to research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, helping to identify a potential biomarker. His drive for deeper insights led him to conduct independent study projects on HIV and AIDS immune evasion, oncology and genetics, and stem cells and organic 3D printing at CSU East Bay. 

Later, after transitioning to oncology research at Cedars-Sinai, Vivek discovered a new passion: computational biology. He began exploring immuno-oncology and genomics, publishing work that characterized the mutational landscape of GI cancers.

> *"It was like solving a puzzle, and the more I saw the gaps in computation in these fields, the more I wanted to fill them."*

Over the last five years, Vivek has focused on software engineering, with the past two dedicated to applying data science and AI to digital pathology and cancer research. Some of his recent work involves:

 - RNA sequencing-based research on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
 - Development of AI models using spatial transcriptomics and vision transformers
 - Automated tools for tumor purity estimation and pathology slide annotation
 - Predictive 3D modeling using autofluorescence and serial H&E tissue section images

He’s also helping build infrastructure for high-output data workflows using AWS. After interacting with Dr. Levy across several conferences, Vivek joined the EDIT AI program in 2024, where he now contributes as a mentor and technical lead for several data-centric projects.

#### Outside the Lab

Vivek balances his intense scientific pursuits with creative outlets. He’s an avid musician — shredding electric guitar, singing R&B and jazz, and playing acoustic sets. A diehard Lakers fan and Los Angeles native, he’s also passionate about basketball.
