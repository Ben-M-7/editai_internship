#### Background

Onyinyechi Owo is a Dartmouth graduate whose academic journey is shaped by a deep commitment to **public service**, **health equity**, and **scientific research**. She is a recipient of the prestigious **Voyager Scholarship for Public Service**, which included opportunities for global service — including work in **Japan**, **Oxford**, **Nigeria**, and across the U.S. — as well as the chance to meet **President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama** on several occasions.

> *“I’m passionate about using science and public health tools to improve wellness at the community level — especially for kids and families who are often overlooked.”*

Her research work reflects that commitment. Onyinyechi has contributed to stroke prevention and health literacy initiatives with **Columbia University’s Neurology Department**, and she was awarded Dartmouth’s **Lombard Public Service Fellowship** for her work supporting underserved communities.

#### Joining EDIT AI

Onyinyechi joined the EDIT AI program during the summer after her sophomore year (2023), through the **POWERED** and **OMNI** programs — selective initiatives that connected a small cohort of New Hampshire students with experiential research opportunities. She was paired with EDIT AI after presenting with fellow researcher Zoe Faith on placental health.

That summer, she co-led an early-stage research initiative that used whole slide images of placental tissue to develop screening tools for miscarriage risk. The project leveraged **QPAP** — a then-cutting-edge approach that combined annotation and AI to accelerate image analysis in pathology.

> *“This was before AI had really taken off. We were working at the frontier — trying to annotate and screen slides more efficiently to catch critical health risks early.”*
