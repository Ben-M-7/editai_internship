#### Background

Hrishikesh (Rishy) Deosthali, 17, is a high school senior from Austin, Texas, with a growing passion for the intersection of **computer science** and **healthcare**. A self-described problem-solver, he first joined the EDIT AI program in the summer of 2024 as part of the Advanced Skills Track.

Initially drawn to coding, Rishy hadn’t seriously considered the healthcare side of tech until EDIT AI exposed him to real-world applications in biomedical research. That summer, he worked on a project exploring the *role of neurotoxic metals in ALS*, using an analytical approach to examine how the presence of metals like iron, zinc, and copper relate to gene expression in the disease.

> *“I didn’t expect to be so interested in the biology side — but understanding the systems behind healthcare through code really clicked for me.”*

#### Looking Ahead

Now entering his senior year, Rishy plans to pursue **computer science in college**, especially where it overlaps with medical innovation and data science. He’s particularly excited by the potential of AI in diagnostics and personalized medicine.

#### Outside the Lab

When he’s not working on code or research, you’ll probably find Rishy on the basketball court or hanging out with friends.
