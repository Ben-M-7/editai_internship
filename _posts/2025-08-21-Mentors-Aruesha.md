#### Background

Aruesha Srivastava, 19, is a sophomore at **Caltech**, where she studies **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science**. Her passion for cancer research began in high school, when she first joined Dr. Levy’s lab, and has since grown into a defining part of her academic and professional journey.  

Currently, her research focuses on **statistical modeling of gene–metal interactions** and how cancer perturbs predictive models. Within EDIT AI, she worked on projects such as *Integration of Elemental Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomic Profiling for Proof-of-Concept Metals-Based Pathway Analysis of the Colon Tumor Microenvironment*.

#### Entrepreneurship

Beyond her academic work, Aruesha is also a **co-founder of a biotech startup**: **SynTest**, a platform for salivary diagnostics. The idea is simple but powerful — via a drop of saliva, the technology can detect biomarkers for cancer, starting with oral cancer. The approach is designed to be **fast, affordable, and accessible**.  

The project is already gaining traction, with Phase I IRB approval and patent-pending technology in progress.

#### Joining EDIT AI

Aruesha joined the **EDIT AI program in 2023** as part of the Advanced Track. She first learned about the program through a friend, and after reaching out directly to Dr. Levy, became involved in high-level projects blending computation, imaging, and cancer biology.  

This year, she returned as a mentor, supporting students in their own projects.  

> *“I’ve really enjoyed being a mentor — it’s rewarding to be on the flip side, helping students and seeing them succeed.”*
