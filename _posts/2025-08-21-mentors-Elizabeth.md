#### Background

Elizabeth Anderson is a PhD student in **Quantitative Biomedical Sciences at Dartmouth College**, where her research focuses on maternal health and placental biology. Originally from Salt Lake City, Utah, Elizabeth’s path into biomedical research has been shaped by a mix of curiosity, persistence, and a passion for applying quantitative methods to pressing health questions.

Her work zeroes in on the placenta — an organ critical to pregnancy and often overlooked in medical research. She has helped coordinate efforts to digitize whole slide images of placental tissue, from both term deliveries and miscarriages. With meticulous effort, she and a team of EDIT students hand-annotated thousands of villi, building a rich dataset that enabled downstream analysis. Partnering with fellow researcher Gokul, Elizabeth helped uncover **significant correlations between placental features and obstetric outcomes**.

Within the Advanced Track, she has focused on **pathology, epidemiology, and computer vision**, bringing her expertise to guide students in tackling complex biomedical image analysis projects.  

Reflecting on the experience, she shares:  

> *“I was so impressed by the energy of the students — it was refreshing to be around so many people who were ready to jump in with both feet.”*
