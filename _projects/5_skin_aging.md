Scientific Premise:
</h3>
There exists cellular components of photoaging which can inform/assess sun age reversal therapies.

Motivation:
</h3>
Skin damage from sun exposure is a major risk factor for developing skin cancer, which poses significant morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate therapeutics which may reverse skin sun damage. Our work aims to uncover unidentified cellular components that are commensurate with sun damage and envision how such information could be used to assess the effectiveness of promising skin sun damage therapeutics.
