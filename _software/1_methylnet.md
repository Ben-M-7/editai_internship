MethylNet is a command line tool and python library that provides classes to handle deep learning tasks for methylation data. It is built off of pythonic MethylationArray data types introduced in (https://github.com/Christensen-Lab-Dartmouth/PyMethylProcess), and uses PyTorch to explore/make predictions on the methylation data.
