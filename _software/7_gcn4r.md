Welcome to the GCN4R package, which is the first R package to allow custom fitting of Graph Neural Networks to social/biological network data. We are currently updating our documentation, but for now you can find a complete description of our work here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.364935v2
